<Td><font color="black">I think that one must have a knowledge of the limits of technology, that it might sound crazy but although technology advances exponentially and makes our facile artificial intelligence, virtual reality among many other technologies could get us out of reality and Everything we have created over the years could destroy us. Turning to the topic that technology could inhibit our knowledge, I think it would be wrong to think about it since, as technology advances, each human being begins to discover things that without that technology would not have been discovered and the knowledge acquired by the Human being increases but that does not mean that all human beings use it with the right purpose.</font></Td>

<Tr>
<Td><font color="black">This is our symbol and represents how virtual reality can somehow distort our reality, for example in the chapter of play test it is exposed that the character or the protagonist confuses reality with the fictitious and maybe the technology could do this with us.</font></Td>
